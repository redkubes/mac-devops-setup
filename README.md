## Using Tags

Tags in Ansible are a powerful feature that allow you to control the execution of your playbook at a granular level. By using tags, you can choose to run only the tasks or roles associated with certain tags.

For example, if you want to run only the tasks that set up Go packages, you can use the `setup_gopackages` tag. Here's how you can do this:

```sh
ansible-playbook setup-my-mac.yml --tags setup_gopackages -K
```
